# mmtypeface

Burmese fonts for the web.

## Overview

Go to the website, select some fonts you wanna use, copy the generated code, and place it inside your project.

You can also do a quick CDN check like this.

```bash
curl https://mmtypeface.vercel.app/api?family=Pyidaungsu:ital,wght@0,400;0,700
```

The output will look something like,

```CSS
/* generated by mmtypeface api */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Pyidaungsu';
  src: url('/fonts/Pyidaungsu/Pyidaungsu-Regular.woff') format('woff'),
       url('/fonts/Pyidaungsu/Pyidaungsu-Regular.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Pyidaungsu';
  src: url('/fonts/Pyidaungsu/Pyidaungsu-Bold.woff') format('woff'),
       url('/fonts/Pyidaungsu/Pyidaungsu-Bold.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
```

## FAQ

### Why?

Inspired by Google Fonts, this is an attempt to create a CDN to serve burmese fonts which Google Fonts won't. This is an alternative to MMWebFonts with proper support for multiple font weights.

### How?

The site is hosted on vercel and API is served via NextJS API Routes, which is handled serverless-ly. The routes are cached for 24-hr until it gets re-deployed or gets a cold start.

### x font is missing?

Contributions of fonts is easy. Just make sure you have the right to publish them before doing that. Then add you font to the `public/fonts` directory, and properly list your files in the `fonts.yaml` file.

Please make sure your fonts are in the `woff` and `woff2` formats. Otherwise we won't accept. You can use [transfonter](https://transfonter.org) to convert if you have to.

### Is this a college project?

Kinda. Credit for the idea goes to [@heinthanth](https://github.com/heinthanth).
